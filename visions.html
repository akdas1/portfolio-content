        <img class="visionimg" src="images/genshin_elements.png" alt="Image of all of the genshin
        visions (elements). From left: pyro, hydro, anemo, electro, dendro, cryo, geo.">
        <div class="captions">
        <p>The above images are symbols of the seven elements
            used in Genshin Impact.</p>
        <p>Visions in Genshin Impact aren't actually what you
            see, but what elements you can use. They're like
            powers and not everyone in the world can use them.
            From my knowledge, they are gifted to one from the
            gods, but we do not know much about them as of yet.
            They can be used with specific weapons to a character
            (you can't choose it's just what the character uses by
            default). They can also be used to gauge elemental
            reactions with other elements (when used together)
            and can be used with specific elemental mechanisms/
            puzzles in the game. Characters also use specific attacks
            based on their vision, with 5 stars containing burst
            animations!</p>
        <h2>What are the types of visions?</h2>
        <p> The visions (elements) that are in Genshin Impact
            are as follows:</p>
        </div>
        <ul class="visionlist">
            <li id="pyro">Pyro which is fire</li>
            <li id="hydro">Hydro which is water</li>
            <li id="anemo">Anemo which is wind</li>
            <li id="electro">Electro which is lightning
            <li id="dendro">Dendro which are plants</li>
            <li id="cryo">Cryo which is ice</li>
            <li id="geo">Geo which is earth</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="captions">
        <p>As mentioned earlier, while attacking and switching
            team characters, you can mix elements to cause a
            reaction. An example of this would be attacking
            with cryo (ice) and pyro (fire) It creates a melting
            effect on the enemies and increases damage. However,
            some opponents are immune to certain elements and
            attack styles, so it's important to strategize. Enemies
            can also have certain weakpoints or advantages based on
            elements interacted with. Weapon types carry bonuses to
            attack, while artifact sets you add to characters do
            the same. Overall, combat in Genshin Impact is complex
            strategy is important. Then again, the point is to have
            fun, so play as you want!</p>
