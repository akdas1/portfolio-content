        <h2>Mondstadt</h2>
        <div class="captions">
        <img src="images/mondstadt.png" alt="Image of Mondstadt, a walled small nation filled with with windmills.">
        <p> Out of seven nations (4 currently released), Mondstadt
            is the first nation we enter as the traveler, looking
            for our lost sibling. We meet characters like Amber,
            Kaeya, Lisa, and more to add them to our starter team.
            We also start our adventure to meet the archon of
            the nation (who does not rule over it to perserve the
            concept of freedom). We meet Venti, the anemo archon
            (can be considered the god of freedom), and fight a
            dragon! Some areas within the Mondstadt region are
            Springvale, Dragonspine, Windrise, etc. Dragonspine
            was released in version 1.2 and features a cold mountain
            area!</p>
        <h2>Liyue</h2>
        <img src="images/liyue_harbor.png" alt="Image of Liyue Harbor, a city with ports, ships, surrounded by water.">
        <p> Liyue is the second nation we enter as the traveler,
            although it was released around similiar times as
            Mondstadt. We meet characters like Xiao, Ningguang,
            Xiangling, and others on our journey and create
            frienships along the way. We continue our exploration
            and search for our sibling, meet new monsters, and
            challenges. Here, we meet the geo archon (can also
            be considered the god of contracts), and fight off
            sea gods who attack Liyue Harbor! Some areas within
            the Liyue region are the Chasm, Qingce village,
            Wangshu Inn, etc. The Chasm was released in the
            version 2.7 update and features an underground map!</p>
        <h3>Inazuma</h3>
        <img src="images/inazuma.png" alt="Image of Inazuma City, a city where the shogun ran, and has a statue of the electro archon.">
        <p> Inazuma is the third nation to be introduced, and the
            first nation to be added after the initial release.
            (Mondstadt and Liyue were released on launch). It is an
            island nation inspired by Japan, and to even get to here,
            we had to complete a quest to travel here due to the
            heavy storms of the seas surrounding Inazuma. The
            conflicts focused on the shogun, implemented the vision
            hunt decree to capture visions from users for the purpose
            of eternity. Here, we also meet characters like Raiden,
            Yae Miko, Thoma, Ayaka, Kazuha (during our travel), and
            more. Some areas within Inazuma are Narukami Island,
            Watatsumi Island, Seirai Island, etc. Some special
            regions within Inazuma are Enkanomiya, released in
            version 2.4, an underground ancient civilization.</p>
        <h3>Sumeru</h3>
        <img src="images/sumeru.jpeg" alt="Image of Sumeru, a city where the academia and wisdom are the main goals.">
        <p>
            Sumeru is fourth and most recent nation to be added.
            The region is also inspired by Middle Eastern and
            South Asian regions. It's practices focuses on the
            Academia, a scholarly organiation within Sumeru City.
            Here, we meet Nahida, the archon of wisdom, Cyno,
            Al Haitham, Nilou, Dehya, and more. Some areas of
            Sumeru are Port Ormos, Avidya Forest, the desert,
            Vanarana, and Old Vanarana. More updates are to come.

            the Desert in Sumeru, and the Golden Apple Archipelago
            (summer event), but I wanted to show current regions
            with separate maps from the main map of Tevyat. Other
            regions are still great!</p>
