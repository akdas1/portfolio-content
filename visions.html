        <h1>The Visions of Genshin Impact</h1>
        <img src="images/genshin_elements.png" alt="Image of all of the genshin
        visions (elements). From left: pyro, hydro, anemo, electro, dendro, cryo, geo.">
        <p>The above images are symbols of the seven elements
            used in Genshin Impact.</p>
        <p>Visions in Genshin Impact aren't actually what you
            see, but what elements you can use. They're like
            powers and not everyone in the world can use them.
            From my knowledge, they are gifted to one from the
            gods (archons). They can be used with specific
            weapons to a character (you can't choose
            it's just what the character uses by default).
            They can also be used to gauge elemental
            reactions with other elements (when used together)
            and can be used with specific elemental mechanisms/
            puzzles in the game.</p>
        <h2>What are the types of visions?</h2>
        <p> The visions (elements) that are in Genshin Impact
            are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pyro which is fire</li>
            <li>Hydro which is water</li>
            <li>Anemo which is wind</li>
            <li>Electro which is lightning
            <li>Dendro which are plants</li>
            <li>Cryo which is ice</li>
            <li>Geo which is earth</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, while attacking and switching
            team characters, you can mix elements to cause a
            reaction. An example of this would be attacking
            with cryo (ice) and pyro (fire) It creates a melting
            effect on the enemies and increases damage. However,
            some opponents are immune to certain elements and
            attack styles, so it's important to strategize. Overall,
            combat in Genshin Impact is complex strategy is important.
            Then again, the point is to have fun, so play as you want!</p>
