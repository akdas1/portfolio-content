        <h1> The Nations of Tevyat</h1>
        <p> The following are the current nations in Genshin Impact
            and are numbered by the release and/or placement in
            storyline adventure: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mondstadt</li>
            <li>Liyue</li>
            <li>Inazuma</li>
            <li>Sumeru</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Mondstadt</h2>
        <img src="images/mondstadt.png" alt="Image of Mondstadt, a walled small nation filled with with windmills.">
        <p> Out of seven nations (4 currently released), Mondstadt
            is the first nation we enter as the traveler, looking
            for our lost sibling. We meet characters like Amber,
            Kaeya, Lisa, and more to add them to our starter team.
            We also start our adventure to meet the archon of
            the nation (who does not rule over it to perserve the
            concept of freedom). We meet Venti, the anemo archon
            (can be considered the god of freedom), and fight a
            dragon!</p>
        <h2>Liyue</h2>
        <img src="images/liyue_harbor.png" alt="Image of Liyue Harbor, a city with ports, ships, surrounded by water.">
        <p> Liyue is the second nation we enter as the traveler,
            although it was released around similiar times as
            Mondstadt. We meet characters like Xiao, Ningguang,
            Xiangling, and others on our journey and create
            frienships along the way. We continue our exploration
            and search for our sibling, meet new monsters, and
            challenges. Here, we meet the geo archon (can also
            be considered the god of contracts), and fight off
            sea gods who attack Liyue Harbor!</p>
        <h3>Inazuma and Sumeru</h3>
